    <title>Getting to know a little bit about me</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Byren Jajuan McGee Jr</h1>
<p>I am a 18 year old from Boston Massachusetts and I am coming to the end of my high school career. Soon I'll be graduating at Fenway Park.
    I grew up around the Dorchester area. I'm a very outgoing individual that always gives everything their all. I have 2 siblings, and I am the oldest in my intermediate family.</p>
I wake up everyday knowing that I will be successful one day, I just need to put the work in. I enjoy playing basketball I actually used to play for my school.(Brighton High)
Reading is also something that interests me because I love learning about new things and always feeding my mind new information.
Exercising is also something that I take pride in doing. I tend to go on morning jog's 5 days a week.
<p>Going on these jog's is my way of keeping my mind and body healthy. I believe that when you look good you feel good. It's important to take care of yourself cause your mental health is very important.</p>
<p>For me this opportunity I've been given to learn how to code is a very life changing opportunity that I had to take advantage of.
    I'm ready to learn more about coding back in middle school I actually used to mess around in terminal and when I'd be on chrome I would go to "Inspect Element" to change certain things on the website.
    Little did I know that I was actually coding. Now I'm actually very interested in learning all about coding because one day I hope to be working for a Fang company so it can change my families lives forever.</p>
<p>Now I'll list a couple words that I believe describe me as a person the best:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Smart</li>
    <li>Leader</li>
    <li>Funny</li>
    <li>Critical thinker</li>
    <li>Trustworthy</li>
    <li>Outgoing</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm so ready to learn more and be the best possible Software Engineer I can become. An that was getting to know me!</p>
